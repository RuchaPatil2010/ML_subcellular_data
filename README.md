# ML_subcellular_data
Use different machine learning models on subcellular data.

Do a complete process of machine learning which include Feature extraction, classification, and analysis.

The project is as follows:

1. Get the protein sequences and extract relevant features that are representative of the protein sequences.

2. Prepare the data (properly put them together with labels) and use different machine learning methods on them (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Bagging). As the data suggest, the problem is hand is a multi-class classification task.

**Note:** The problem is protein subcellular localization. The proteins can function in different locations in the cell. Given a protein, it is important to identify its functioning location. Fore this problem, we are working with Gram-positive bacterial proteins which function in 4 locations in the cell. So, the problem is to get the training data, extract relevant feature, and build a model to predict the functioning location for a given protein.

3. Analyze and interpret your output using different approaches such as:
	1. Using independent test set
	2. k-fold cross validation
	3. check different accuracy measurement
	4. Discuss your results and interpret the output
